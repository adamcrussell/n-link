This is an implementation of the recursive procedure described on page 329 in
section 8.6 of:
    Computational Geometry in C (2nd Ed.) 
    Joseph O'Rourke, Cambridge University Press 1998

The code is mostly contained in reachability.pl but for convenience there are
also two small utility classes (Annulus.pm and Circle.pm).

In addition to the recursive implementation I have also added an iterative 
version. Profiler testing with a large (up to 5000) number of links revealed
significant performance issues! This code may be interesting for anyone
wanting to see perl's abilities for deep recursion. 

Gnuplot is used to visualize the link arm configuration that is found.

The nbproject directory contains a NetBeans project file. I've included this
so that these files may be easily opened as a NetBeans project. I highly
recommend the following plugin for anyone using Perl in NetBeans:
